title: "Learning to Recommend Method Names with Global Context"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/GTNM
excerpt: "Propose a novel global approach for method name suggestion, which considers the local context, the project level context, and the documentation of the method simultaneously. We employ a transformer-based seq2seq framework to generate the method names and use the attention mechanism to allow the model to attend to different level contexts when generating the names. The model substantially improves the performance of the previous approaches on suggesting Java method names."
